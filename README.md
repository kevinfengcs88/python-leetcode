# LeetCode (Python)

This repository contains source code for my LeetCode solutions in Python. I've created this repository in order to familiarize myself more with Python syntax. This repository was not created under the same philosophy as [my Java LeetCode solutions repository](https://github.com/kevinfengcs88/leetcode). That being said, these solutions will refrain from taking too much inspiration from forum posts or other sources of already-curated solutions.

## Structure

This repository contains three folders: Easy, medium, and hard, which correspond to LeetCode problems of the corresponding difficulty. Unlike my Java solutions repository, explanations will be included in commented code rather than in Markdown.
